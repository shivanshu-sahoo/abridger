A)In this, we provide an easy interface where students can either provide an image of their books or notes, links to pages of interests or can directly provide an paragraph and our program will provide an summary of the text (with the option of the length of the summary) Which will highly benefit them for reading and last minute revision 

B)Based on the images or links or paragraphs provided by the user, we provide with a quiz generated upon the topic given in the texts provided by them and also check the correctness of the answers
